        <h2>The Life of Money Motley</h2>
        <div id="left-container-art">
          <section id="left-art">
            <p>Adrienne Motley goes through the same routine before every basketball game. She prays during the national anthem, taps her chest and points her finger up toward God.</p>

            <p>“My big thing is praying before the game, to relax and talk to God,” Motley said.</p>

            <p>Motley said she is superstitious and heavily relies on keeping things consistent. Before every home game, she listens to Biggie Smalls in the training room, and when she is on the road, she switches to “You Don’t Know” by Jay-Z.</p>

	           <p>Motley, 20, is a junior at the University of Miami majoring in electronic media and minoring in advertising.</p>


             <p> During the 2015-2016 season, Motley started all 33 games, posted double figures in 29 games, and led the team in field goals made with 214. Motley has earned national recognition with these outstanding numbers, making her a WNBA prospect.</p>

	            <p>Her recognitions go beyond the classroom and directly to the court. Motley is on the Wade’s Watch list, Naismith Trophy Player of the Year Early Season Watch List, and the Blue Ribbon Panel First Team All-ACC & ACC Coaches First Team All-ACC, to name a few. But, when asked about what she was most proud of</p>

          <section id="center-art">
              <p>and what she hopes to accomplish for her senior year, she doesn’t refer to awards.</p>

	            <p>She cracked a huge smile exposing her teeth when describing the field of television production. It is something that she truly enjoys, other than basketball.</p>

	             <p>“I’m going to be a senior next year,” she said. “Stuff is going to be very real”. Motley nodded her head and placed her fingers on her chin in disbelief and slight disappointment that her years at the U are coming to an end.</p>

               <p>“All my recognitions are all blessings,” Motley said. “I really just want an ACC championship and a ring.” The Hurricanes could not accomplish their goal of winning a title this year; they did make it to the playoffs.</p>

	              <p>As a co-captain, Motley pushes the team to reach their goals. She is very quiet and focused around her teammates. Motley’s position as a guard allows her to become the team’s playmaker. She keeps her head high while dribbling the ball down the court and doesn’t think twice about calling a play. Motley portrays confidence.</p>

                <p>“I just try to lead by example, “ she said. “I’m not much for words on the court.

              <p>I try not talk so much and just lead. Actions can speak for your words.”</p>

              <p> Roderick Dunlap, a member on the scout team, practices with the girl’s basketball team and see’s Motleys dedication on the court. Dunlap says that often times Motley stays after practice to work on drills to perfect her game.</p>

	            <p> “She’s a very focused player,” he said. “She’s always in tuned either both in practice and in the game.”</p>

	            <p>Motleys discipline is no surprise to those around her. The WNBA prospect and current Miami Hurricanes guard and co-captain on the Women’s Basketball was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands to a military household. Her mother, Norma Motley, was in the army and her father, Adrian Motley, was in the air force. She moved to the United States when she was 2-years-old and fell in love with the game of basketball when she was 5-years-old. Motley has spoken to her parents about going turning pro, but isn’t emphasizing it for the moment.</p>

	            <p>“If it happens, it happens,” Motley said, “and if not I still have my degree to bad myself up.”</p>
